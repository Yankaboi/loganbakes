So far, I have made a chocolate cake, biscoff cheesecake, brownies, coffee and walnut, carrot cake, victoria sponge and fresh cream cake,a basic school cake.I can basically make anything that you desire. My name is logan. I am a 15 year old who is trying to save up for a trip to Africa, Namibia. The purpose of this trip is so i get the opportunity to help animals and people in need. I need to raise just over £4300 so  I can go. I am doing many fund raising methods and other things like baking cakes and washing cars that will help to raise the money. Everything that I achieve is regularly posted onto my facebook. If you have a order, I politely ask that you send it through a direct message on facebook. Curently, I am trying to delelop a way for online payments but at the minute, all payments are going to the go fund me so myself and others can see how much I am raising. </p>
